# LLM Glossary Memory
# -------------------
# Purpose:
# - Provide deterministic phrase-based overrides for section placement and status normalization.
# - Reduce ambiguity for team/domain-specific terms.
#
# How it works:
# - terms: if item description contains "phrase" (case-insensitive), section is forced to "section".
# - status_hints: if item description contains "phrase", status is forced to "status".
# - If multiple phrases match, the first match in this file wins.
# - Section value can be:
#   1) full label (example: "Top Focus > HA Log Sync Enhancement")
#   2) category label (example: "Infrastructure")
#   3) section id if known (example: "S1_2")
#
# Status values supported:
# - done
# - in testing
# - in progress
# - other
#
# Setup:
# - Set `llm_glossary_path` in config.yaml (or `LLM_GLOSSARY_PATH` env var).
# - Leave unset to disable glossary memory.
