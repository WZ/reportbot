# LLM Glossary Memory Example
#
# Purpose:
# - Add deterministic phrase-to-section hints.
# - Normalize status keywords before/alongside LLM classification.
#
# Behavior:
# - Matching is case-insensitive.
# - First match wins within each list.
# - Keep this file short and high-signal.
#
# Setup:
# - Set llm_glossary_path in config.yaml to this file path.
# - Leave llm_glossary_path empty to disable glossary memory.
